        <p>
            The <a href="/database" class="button">database</a> contains data
            of 200 DNA sequences provided by BLAST. In total 174 sequences had
            one or more results. Only the first 30 results per sequence have
            been saved to the database. If a sequence had less than 30 results,
            all of its results have been saved. The database can be searched
            with multiple parameters.

                First of all, a Python script was made to automatically BLAST
                200 DNA sequences, in which the tool biopyton was used. All of
                the data which BLAST provided was saved to an XML file. Then, a
                Python function was made to parse the XML file, and retrieve
                the important data. In addition, a Python function was made to
                automatically insert the retrieved data into a self-created
                database. <br>
                Secondly, this website was created, aided by Python and the
                Flask package.
